# File-handling-Exception-Handling-OOPs

This project contains solutions to 10 different Python exercises, each focusing on file handling, exception management, and class inheritance. Each exercise is independent and can be executed separately.

Exercises Overview
Exercise 1: (score: 1)
Objective: Write a Python program to read a file and display its contents.

Input: File path
Output: The contents of the file will be printed on the console.
Exercise 2: (score: 1)
Objective: Write a Python program to copy the contents of one file to another file.

Input: Source file path and destination file path
Output: The destination file will contain the copied contents of the source file.
Exercise 3: (score: 1)
Objective: Write a Python program to read the content of a file and count the total number of words in that file.

Input: File path
Output: Total number of words in the file will be displayed.
Exercise 4: (score: 1)
Objective: Write a Python program to read the content of a file and count the number of occurrences of a specific word in that file.

Input: File path and a word to count
Output: Number of occurrences of the specified word in the file.
Exercise 5: (score: 1)
Objective: Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a string and converts it to an integer. Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions.

Input: User input (string)
Output: The string converted to an integer or an error message if conversion fails.
Exercise 6: (score: 1)
Objective: Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a list of integers and raises an exception if any of the integers in the list are negative.

Input: A list of integers from user input
Output: Exception message if a negative integer is found.
Exercise 7: (score: 1)
Objective: Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a list of integers and computes the average. Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions and use the finally clause to indicate the program has finished running.

Input: A list of integers from user input
Output: The average of the integers or an error message in case of invalid input.
Exercise 8: (score: 1)
Objective: Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a filename and writes a string to that file. Use try-except blocks to handle any exceptions and print a welcome message if there is no exception.

Input: Filename and a string
Output: The string will be written to the specified file, and a welcome message will be displayed if no exception occurs.
Exercise 9: (score: 1)
Objective: Build a program to manage a university's course catalog using class inheritance.

Classes:
Course: Base class with properties like course_code, course_name, and credit_hours.
CoreCourse: Inherits from Course and has an additional property required_for_major (boolean).
ElectiveCourse: Inherits from Course and has an additional property elective_type (e.g., "general", "technical", "liberal arts").
Exercise 10: (score: 1)
Objective: Create a Python module named employee that contains a class Employee with attributes name, salary, and methods get_name() and get_salary(). Write a program to create an object of the Employee class and display its name and salary.

Module: employee.py
Class: Employee with attributes name and salary.
Methods: get_name() and get_salary().
Output: Display the name and salary of the employee object.
